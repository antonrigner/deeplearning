# deeplearning

This is a repository for the Neural Networks and Deep Learning course at NTU.

Tools used: Python 3.7.0 with Tensorflow 1.10.0, NumPy and Matplotlib

The following models have been developed in the course, and I have tried to further optimize & experiment with the models after course completion.

    * Object recognition with a CNN model
        * Optimizer evaluation
    * Wikipedia text classification
        * CNN / RNN models on char and word sequence
        * GRU / LSTM / multi-layer RNN
    * MNIST handwritten digit classification
    * Multi-variable regression
